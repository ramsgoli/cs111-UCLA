Included files:
- lab0.c 
	The file lab0.c contains the source code for project 0. It is a program that redirects stdin to stdout, and supports
	redirecting using specific files as stdin and stdout by using the --input and --output options. It also supports creating a segmentation
	fault by using the --segfault options, and catching the fault with the --catch option (so that the program exits cleanly).
- Makefile
	Used for building the program binary and tarball
- backtrace.png
	A screenshot of the segault and associated stack trace
- breakpoint.png
	A screenshot of the breakpoint placed in the code and variable inspection of the NULL pointer

Smoke Test;
I tested the correct use of the --input and --output flag by redirecting the content of lab0.c to a dummy file named output.txt
I then asserted that the return code of this command was 0, indicating success. 

I tested that using an unknown option returns an exit code of 1.
I tested that specifying an input file that does not exist returns an exit code of 2.
I tested that specifying an output file without the proper write permissions returns an exit code of 3
	I used the P0_check.sh file for inspiration to perform this test. I touched a file and then changed its permissions
	to read-only (chmod 444)
I tested that using the --segfault and --catch options returns an exit code of 4.

Additional resources:
I visted this web site: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getopt.3.html to learn more about getopt_long(). I used the provided example code
(specifically the use of the options struct) as inspiration for my own implementation

I also used this web site: http://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/ to learn more about how to write a proper Makefile
