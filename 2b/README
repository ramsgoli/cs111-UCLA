QUESTIONS

2.3.1 - Cycles in the basic list implementation
---------------------------------------------------
Where do you believe most of the cycles are spent in the 1 and 2-thread list tests ?
-   Most of the cycles are spent executing the list operations, since there is not much contention

Why do you believe these to be the most expensive parts of the code?
// TODO

Where do you believe most of the time/cycles are being spent in the high-thread spin-lock tests?
-   Most of the time is spent in the wasteful 'spinning.' In the high-thread tests, 
    there are more threads that are being scheduled. But since the lock is only
    held by one thread, the many other threads spend their scheduled time just spinning, and 
    thus less operations are able to be performed overall.

Where do you believe most of the time/cycles are being spent in the high-thread mutex tests?
-
