Notes:

According to the instructions provided to us in the spec, I should have been able to ssh to the beaglebone at root@192.168.6.2. 
However, even after installing the correct drivers and restarting my host computer as instructed, I still could not ssh to the beaglebone. 
In order to fix the problem, I connected my host computer to the wifi signal created by the beaglebone. 
I was then able to ssh to root@192.168.8.1, and this correctly opened up a ssh session from my host computer to the beaglebone.
I have still not managed to be able to ssh into the beaglebone solely over a USB connection.
This current solution, though works, is inconvenient because my host computer no longer can connect to the school internet while I am ssh'd into the beaglebone.
